# Reflection
The development of test cases and use cases for the Smart Inventory System was a challenging task. One of the main challenges was ensuring that the test cases covered all the functional requirements of the system. Another challenge was ensuring that the use cases accurately represented the interactions between the actors and the system.

To overcome these challenges, I used a combination of techniques such as use case diagrams, use case specifications, and test case development. I also ensured that the test cases were comprehensive and covered all the functional requirements of the system.

In conclusion, the development of test cases and use cases for the Smart Inventory System was a challenging but rewarding task. It required careful planning, attention to detail, and a thorough understanding of the system's functional requirements.
